what's AHB and i-bus && d-bus connect to flash 
s-bus connect to AHB and it also connect to apb bus
 APB on the other hand is slower bus compared to the  AHB bus. Which will run at the speed of 45 and 
90 MHz in this microcontroller So, the maximum speed of  a APB2 bus is 90MHz and the maximum speed at which APB1 runs
is actually 45MHz.
So, these are actually slower buses APB. And all these peripheral like TIMERs,USART,SPI,ADC,I2C
So, these peripherals are actually hanging to APB bus, not to AHB bus. And the GPIOs are actually hanging on the 
1-Is it true that, System Bus is not connected to FLASH memory? true
2-Processor can fetch instructions from SRAM over ICode bus interface? false
3-System bus can operate at the speed up to 180 MHz? true.
4- SRAMs are connected to system bus ? true
5-APB1 bus can  operate  at the speed up to 180 MHz?false
6- I have a peripheral whose data sheet says that, it's operating frequency or speed must be above 95MHz,
Can I connect that peripheral  via APB2 bus? not possible 
7-Processor can fetch instructions as well as data simultaneously from SRAM? false
8-Processor can fetch instructions as well as data simultaneously from FLASH?true
What is the  Max
9-HCLK 180MHz
10-P1CLK 45MHz
11-P2CLK 90MHz
12- GPIOs and processor communicate over AHB1 bus? true
13-USB OTG  and processor communicate over AHB2 bus? true
14-OTG  and GPIOs  can communicate to processor concurrently or simultaneously? false
15-Processor can  talk to flash memory and SRAM simultaneously?true

he talk about GPIO 
• Input floating
• Input pull-up
• Input-pull-down
• Analog
• Output open-drain with pull-up or pull-down capability
• Output push-pull with pull-up or pull-down capability
• Alternate function push-pull with pull-up or pull-down capability
• Alternate function open-drain with pull-up or pull-down capability
@ sec 25 he start to talk about lib and how to make iy
